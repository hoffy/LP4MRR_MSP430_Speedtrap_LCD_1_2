I discovered recently while reviewing this repository that the schematic design had two serious "but not dangerous" issues that needed to be corrected.  The pinout for the LCD was backwards, and a ground trace was missing on the schematic.  These issues have been resolved.  I have also included larger versions of the schematic and breadboard layouts in both PDF & PNG formats,

There is currently no Circuit Board design associated with this project.  If anyone wishes to develop one that provides for the MSP430G2553 IC and a regulated 3.3 Volts & 5 Volt Supply as required for the circuit please by all means do so and share.  I'm all about fair attribution and open to improvement ideas.
